# VirtualDub
Originally written by Avery Lee, abandoned in 2013 but still in use by many people. Now with Voukoder!

## Installation
Simply run the executable file.

## Requirements
The [Voukoder Core](https://github.com/Vouk/voukoder) component in version 2.3 or later needs to be installed. Otherwise the "Export >  Voukoder..." menu entry is disabled.

## Development
This repository and its builds are based on the last available source code provided on the SourceForge project website. The project has been converted to MSVS 2017. YASM 1.20 is also required (1.3.0 will not work!). It has to be an x64 build so it can find the 64bit Voukoder COM server. Feel free to contribute.
