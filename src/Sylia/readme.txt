Readme for Sylia 0.1 interpreter
================================

Sylia is a really simple scripting language.  It has no flow control and is
very loosely typed.  It's really only meant for the scripting/job system
in VirtualDub, but you might find some other use for it.  Scripting help
is given in the help file, but you'll have to look at VirtualDub
(script.cpp) to figure out how to use it in a program.  It's basically a
fully interpreted and on-the-fly-tokenizing C--, so it's not exactly a
speed demon either.

It should be fully reentrant, though.

Oh yeah, and here's the paragraph you've all been waiting to see:
