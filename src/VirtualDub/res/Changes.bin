   * New /i (invoke) command line flag runs a script and passes additional parameters to it, which are available as VirtualDub.params[n].
   * Unescaped, native-coded strings can now be embedded in a script using U"..." syntax. In particular, this allows filenames to be inserted directly from a batch file.
   * The Abort button on the dub status dialog now confirms by default for non-preview operations; this can be disabled in Preferences.

   [bugs fixed]
   * "AVIFile compatibility mode" no longer needs to be manually checked in extended AVI options when opening Avisynth scripts.

   * Fixed volume setting warping when saving job entries.

Build 21540 (1.6.0, experimental): [September 7, 2004]
   [features added]
   * Native AMD64 build (see Release Notes for restrictions).
   * New "perspective" video filter can deproject subimages that are displayed obliquely in a scene.
   * YUV formats can now be directly selected for decompression and compression.
   * Planar YUV formats are now supported for both display and output.
   * Added preliminary DirectX 9 (D3D9) display driver support, with support for filter mode selection and multipass bicubic filtering. This driver must be manually enabled in Preferences.
   * Added OpenGL display driver, with support for filter mode selection. This driver must be manually enabled in Preferences.
   * Frame seeking is now incremental so that extremely long frame distances between key frames no longer hang the app during the preload.
   * Added support for the PRELOAD flag on video decompression to speed up seeking.
   * New position slider that displays frame number markers and supports mouse wheel scrolling beyond 32K.
   * Fast recompress format is reported in log.

   [optimizations]
   * Major optimizations to Resize video filter.
   * SSE2-optimized IDCT kernel.

   [workarounds]
   * Added workaround for codecs that pass decode queries for formats they can't actually decode. VirtualDub will only use these codecs to decode formats with FOURCCs that the codec is registered with, or that the codec naturally produces.
   * Improved workaround for codecs that unmask FPU exceptions in their DLL initialization, particularly FP Divide by Zero (which can cause other codecs to crash).

   [bugs fixed]
   * Expanded a number of internal variables to 64-bit to reduce problems with long streams that have more than 2^31 bytes or samples.
   * Fixed crash when opening file for first time with output pane disabled.

   * Fixed crash when changing priority in the middle of render termination.
   * Fixed 3072 sample delay in "center cut" audio filter.
   * Aggressive AVI recovery was very slow when processing large blocks of invalid data, such as 8MB of nulls.
   * Fixed leak of handles in frameclient driver that was causing Windows XP Explorer to keep AVI files open frameclient proxy mode was enabled.
   * Jobs using WAV file audio didn't close the WAV file after completion, keeping it locked across subsequent jobs.
   * Appended file lists were being written out in job scripts in ANSI rather than UTF-8, causing problems with high-plane characters.
   * Audio information in File Information wasn't taking all samples into account.
   * Long paths in the most recently used (MRU) list now ellipsize.
   * Lowered priority of livelock messages to Info so they don't flag as warnings in the job queue.
   * Fixed race condition that sometimes resulted in final B frames not being flushed completely.
   * "Butterfly" audio filter didn't work with 8-bit audio.
   * Unbuffered I/O is now disabled on non-hard-disk paths for better efficiency on slow links, particularly over networks.
   * Frameserver paths longer than 64 bytes prevented the frameclient from connecting properly.
   * Improved input validation on frame rate entry fields to catch period/comma mixups.

   [features added]
   * Made 'autodetect additional segments by filename'
     option sticky.
   * Removed trackbar ticks when ticks are a solid bar
     to speed up edits on very long timelines.
   * Added option to disable use of DirectX in video
     displays under Preferences/Display.

   [bugs fixed]
   * Fixed odd lock-to-keyframe behavior with edit lists
     that have out of order segments.

     jobs created from entire directories.

   [regressions fixed]

     or Remote Desktop clients are detected to work around
     a DirectX clipping bug.
   * Re-enabled places bar on open and save dialogs.
   * Disabled FPU state warning and made the fixup silent.
     WAY too many drivers are screwing up the FPU unit.
   * Edit lists can now be omitted from configuration
     files without needing to close the source file.

   [bugs fixed]
   * Main window is disabled during MPEG-1 scan to prevent
     crash if main window is closed.
   * Previous-key and next-key movement commands were not
     correct for B-frames in an MPEG-1 file.
   * Fixed decoding of MPEG-1 B-frames at the start of
     GOPs with broken_link set.
   * Palette change blocks no longer appear as garbage
     video streams.  In-stream palette changes are still
     not supported, however.
   * biSizeImage was incorrect when using fast recompress
     in YV12 mode.
   * Sequence appends failing on the first file now throw
     an error rather than a warning.

   [regressions fixed]

Current build (1.5.7, stable):    [October 20, 2003]
   [bugs fixed]
   * Quick preview didn't work if the current position was
     past the number of source frames, even if the timeline
     was longer than that.
   * Added FPU guards that were missing in a couple of
     critical places (AVIFile open, codec negotation).
   * The timeline wasn't properly extended if segments were
     auto-attached by filename after edits had been made.
   * Configuration scripts saved when no file is open
     no longer alter the edit list when loaded.
   * Jobs launched from the command line used the normal
     error modes rather than those set as default by the
     user.

   [regressions fixed]
   * Filter preview buttons weren't updating the frame.
   * Save Image Sequence command would randomly produce
     an unrequested job instead of initiating the render
     directly.
   * Append AVI function was incrementing the filename
     extension instead of the name component.
   * Avisynth scripts smaller than 60 bytes weren't being
     autodetected properly.
   * MP3 audio streams were getting written with
     dwLength=0 if correction was enabled.
   * MPEG decoder occasionally decoded garbage into the
     video frame, resulting in sporadic block errors
     during processing.

     for UYVY and YUY2 modes.
   * Video display updates are now suppressed for panes
     that are totally hidden.

   [bugs fixed]
   * MP3 rate correction was correcting dwRate but not
     interleaving, causing some problems for embedded
     decoders.  The interleaving rate is now adjusted
     on the fly.  Note that MP3 correction is still not
     enabled when segmentation is active.
   * Time base for the position control was improperly
     affected by the "convert to fps" option.
   * "Box blur" filter was broken on CPUs without MMX.
     (Dumb compiler bugs....)

     fixed vertical layout and pane swap.
   * Fixed crash when loading some job configurations from
     1.5.4 and below.
   * Fixed audio displacement not working in simple audio
     pipeline with forward offset.
   * Adjusted Z-order of status bar relative to panes.

     automatic.
   * Log windows now have a context menu for clearing,
     copying, and saving the log text.
   * Modified AVI2 indexing to relax indexing restrictions
     somewhat, although it's still not user configurable
     yet.

     a find or save command.
   * "Attach extension" option didn't work for signpost
     save dialog.

     operation, and then occur again when attempting to
     gracefully finalize the partial output file.
   * "Clear" didn't work in audio filter graph.
   * Fixed I/O errors when attempting to push audio forward
     with advanced audio filtering enabled.
   * "Go to" command didn't handle timestamps with frac-
     tional seconds that only had 1 or 2 decimal digits.
   * "General convolution" generated bad code for factors
     of 2, 4, and 8 when dynamic compilation was enabled.
   * Interleave periods of zero are no longer allowed.
   * Added workaround for crash or hang when compressing
     with the "3ivx D4 4.0.4" video codec.
   * Fixed non-interleaved save mode and made it cooperate
     with segmentation.
   * Added workaround for heap corruption when processing

     Avisynth.
   * Clarified DivX warning to note that it doesn't apply
     to the DivX 4+ codecs.
   * Fixed filter cropping not working properly when
     "motion blur" was the first filter in the chain.

Build 16296 (Version 1.5.4):          [May 28, 2003]
   [features added]
   * Added workaround for infinite B-frame delay
     interaction with DivX 5.0.5 Pro.

     that was more likely to occur in Windows 95/98.
   * Key frame markers were getting written on some drop
     frames when upsampling the video stream.
   * MPEG code was issuing warnings whenever decode time-
     stamps were more than 0.62s apart; this has been
     fixed to use the actual spec limit of 0.7s.
   * Operation couldn't be aborted while B-frame lag
     frames were being flushed at the end.
   * Fixed a bad error message that displayed a bogus
     filename.

Build 16250 (Version 1.5.3):          [May 19, 2003]
   [features added]
   * Added preview input/output commands to menu and
     accelerator tables.
   * Program close allowed during a preview operation.

   [changes]
   * Tweaked job control behavior for jobs that complete
     with warnings, to be a bit more intuitive.

   [bugs fixed]
   * Frame marking didn't always mark the correct range and
     could cause "Scan for bad frames" to fail.
   * Fixed invalid batch scripts produced when video codec
     has a config struct larger than ~6K (Windows Media 9
     VCM).
   * Status markers were being logged as warnings in jobs.
   * Conversion to a higher frame rate produced amusing
     results in Direct video mode.  It now produces source
     frames interspersed with drop frames for nearly zero-
     cost point upsampling of video.
   * Dubber pretended there was a input-to-output lag if
     such filters existed in the video chain (temporal
     smoother), even if the filters weren't active.  This
     resulting in duplicated frames (fast/normal) or
     erroneous zero-byte keyframes (direct) at the end of
     the output.
   * Arbitrary framerate conversion option wasn't disabled
     in the UI when IVTC was enabled (the two are mutually
     exclusive).
   * Edit point seeks (<, >) didn't update the frame
     windows.

   [regression bugs fixed]
   * Fixed pipeline not getting flushed at end of
     operation, resulting in some frames getting lost.
   * Fixed subset code pulling in wrong frames in direct
     mode.
   * Interleaving values were inverted and thus always
     forced one-per-frame.
   * Position slider wasn't updating properly around cuts.

Build 16188 (Version 1.5.2):          [April 30, 2003]

   * Converted help from WinHelp to HTML and updated dialog
     help to current feature set.
   * Added frame rate conversion to arbitrary frame rates.
   * Added logging to report non-fatal warnings during
     operations.
   * MPEG parser detects and reports timestamp
     discontinuities.

     handlers.
   * Optimized audio filters a bit and added tap count
     control for lowpass, highpass, and resampling filters.
   * Added "new rate" audio filter to relabel an audio
     stream with a new sampling rate without resampling.
   * Incomplete audio format headers that are rejected by
     ACM MP3 codecs are automatically fixed with the
     required fields (the infamous "tag 0055" problem).
   * Added workaround for AVI1 files with MP3 audio being
     detected as MP3 files by Windows Media Player 8.

   [features removed]
   * Removed coach dialogs.  Not helpful enough and too
     outdated to maintain.

     the last filter in the library (regression in 1.5
     series).

     output filter with autoconnect on and no place for it
     to attach.
   * Fixed livelock at end of operation when lowpass/
     highpass audio filters were in use.
   * Fixed internal error when attempting to start an
     incomplete audio filter graph (unconnected pins).

     to audio AVI track headers when converting an MPEG-1
     file.
   * Fixed crash when attempting to load an AVI stream with
     an invalid sample rate (zero or infinite).  Added code
     to guess and substitute a reasonable value.
   * Fixed small memory leak in "smoother" video filter.

        /p[input_file],[output_file]
   * Filters are now loaded and unloaded on the fly to
     circumvent TLS (thread local storage) selector limits.
   * Cropping bounds can now be dragged via the mouse.
   * Improved, friendlier crash diagnostics.
   * Basic audio filter support (no plugin support yet,
     though).  The pitch shifter sucks.

     from microsecond to rational calculations.
   * Changed font on dialogs to enable ClearType on XP.

   [features removed]
   * Deleted outdated 3x3 average filter -- it has been
     superceded by "blur."

   [bug fixes]
   * New MPEG audio core (Priss) -- fixes decoding errors
     in layer I and layer III audio and adds SSE polyphase
     support.

     WAV file.
   * Outputted configuration files and job scripts now
     include the correct audio filename when a .wav file is
     selected through a script.

   [features added]
   * Added frequently-requested Lanzcos3 kernel to resize
     filter. Can't see any difference whatsoever.

   [bug fixes]
   * Fixed nasty resize filter bug and RGB24<->RGB32
     conversion errors on odd bitmap widths.
     (Regressions in 1.4.12)
   * Fixed audio desynchronization when processing
     compressed audio in direct stream copy mode with both
     a start offset and deleted segments.  Thanks to Cyrius
     for the bug report and fix.
   * Audio compression system now drops a final partial
     block from an audio codec -- Microsoft ADPCM was
     producing these, resulting in a runt AVI stream
     sample. The new behavior matches that of Sound
     Recorder.
   * A partial final block no longer triggers the VBR audio
     adjustment routine.
   * "Previous keyframe" from beyond the end no longer
     seeks to start if frames have been deleted or masked.
     Also thanks to Cyrius.
   * Fixed crash in MPEG-1 decoder when playing or saving a
     video stream with D-frames or invalid frame types.
   * B-frame audio skew support is now also enabled for the
     'XVID' video format.

Build 14303 (Version 1.4.12):          [November 23, 2002]
   [features added]
   * Parts of the MPEG-1 decoder, some color conversion
     functions, and parts of the resize filter have been
     optimized for SSE2 (Pentium 4).
     
   [bug fixes]
   * Fixed intermittent deadlock during playback caused
     by non-atomic thread synchronization. This affects
     SMP systems as well as CPUs with HyperThreading
     Technology.
   * Fixed Save Image Sequence regression in 1.4.11 that
     caused the directory portion of the dialog to be
     ignored.
   * Fixed broken copyProc support.

     their index if video frames weren't all the same
     size.
   * Fixed some subset-related position slider glitches.
   * RLE AVI files weren't being decompressed correctly
     (GDI's RLE isn't the same as AVI's RLE).
   * Fixed crash disassembler not disassembling some
